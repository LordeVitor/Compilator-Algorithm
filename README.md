# Compilator-Algorithm
A fictional language compilation algorithm

Algorithm made with the purpose of converting a data input into a fictitious language and transforming it into a compiled language, in my algorithm the conversion language was C#

The algorithm only converts the fictional language into a compiled language, in future updates it must compile and return the data to the user
